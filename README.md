# DraftJs-Editor

### Description

This project is an editor built using Draft.js within ReactJS. The editor has three main components: Title, Button, and Editor. It allows users to write and format text using Markdown-like syntax.

### Features

- **Heading Format**: Typing `#` as the first character in a line followed by space changes the text to a heading format.
- **Bold Format**: Typing `*` as the first character in a line followed by space makes the text bold.
- **Red Line Format**: Typing `@` as the first characters in a line followed by space changes the text color to red.
- **Underline Format**: Typing `_` as the first characters in a line followed by space underlines the text.
- **Save Button**: Pressing the "Save" button saves the content typed in the editor to local storage. Upon refreshing the page, the saved content is refilled into the editor.
